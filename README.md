# Little_Bang_Board
This project is for a Virtual Pinball game controller based on a Rasberry Pi Pico using CircuitPython.  The Little Bang Board provides a virtual ball plunger using the game controller Z axis of a joystick output.  An accelerometer provides X/Y movement to the applicable game controller X/Y joystick output. A true USB keyboard HID emulation provides 16 buttons that can emulate any key.  Basic pinball game controllers can cost anywhere from $40 to $125. The Little Bang Board will set you back $10 and will be as good if not better than the more expensive competition. THis project can also be purchased as a complete kit for under $20.  This project is offered as is, and free to copy and use provided that it is not used for profit unless my written permission.  
Items in this project that I am providing include Instructions, BOM, PCB fab files (gerbers and drill files) links to Adafruit CircuitPython for Pico, links to Adafruit CircuitPython libraries, schematics, config.txt, Code.py -Main Code, and Boot.py -boot code.  Alternately, I am including a sample script for using Pinscape Pico which is the preferred software for this project. For information and code download concerning MJR's Pinscape for Pico please follow his GitHub page at https://github.com/mjrgh/PinscapePico.  Please enjoy this project.
